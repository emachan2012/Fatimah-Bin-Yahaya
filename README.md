==================================================

I grew up in a learning environment. My Father motivated me to pursue education and development.

I'm a Computer Scientist interested in graphics design, AI, and 3D modeling, and I skilled Python, and Adobe Suites for my work with experiences.

My graduation project is a Kindergarten registration system, The system will display the nearest kindergartens from the user's location and display information about the kindergarten

I have excellent knowledge in Python, PHP, Laravel and Adobe Suites, polishing, and publishing them to the target audience.
